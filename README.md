## Purpose

This is a portfolio website for displaying myself as a developer and IT professional. I have listed my skills, interests, professional knowledge and showcase of my abilities with HTML and CSS.

## Functionality/ features

The main functionality of the site is to showcase myself as a future developer. The site features scalable elements for many types of screen sizes.

The small/mobile view features a 'hamburger' menu, with menu overlay which slides in from the right of the screen. This was made with a HTML checkbox and styled with CSS.

The medium/tablet view (and larger) feature scalable elements with a menu header which lets the user know which page they are on. The social media elements are based on the footer - to the left for medium, and at the bottom centre for large/desktop.
